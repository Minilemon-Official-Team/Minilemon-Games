Thanks for purchasing TOON Harbor Pack!
Glad to have you as a customer.

Two easy steps are required in order to ensure proper function of the pack.

	1. Please make sure you install the proper version in your Unity Project. At the moment,
only built-in (2019.4.40 and later) and URP (2021.3.0 and later) are supported. An installer for
URP for 2023.1.0 will be added soon.

	2. Enjoy!
